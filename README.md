Source code for Transfer Spectral Clustering (TSC) [1]. TSC makes use of co-clustering to achieve and control the knowledge transfer among tasks. TSC improved the clustering performance by about %6 comparied with seperate spectral clustering in terms of normalized mutual information, cluster purity and rand index.
